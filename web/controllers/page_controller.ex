  # Strategy denotes what kind of fuse we have.
  #
  # Standard fuses, {standard, MaxR, MaxT}. These are fuses which
  # tolerate MaxR melt attempts in a MaxT window, before they break down.
  #
  # Fault injection fuses, {fault_injection, Rate, MaxR, MaxT}. This
  # fuse type sets up a fault injection scheme where the fuse fails
  # at rate Rate, an floating point value between 0.0â€“1.0. If you
  # enter, say 1 / 500 then roughly every 500th request will se a
  # blown fuse, even if the fuse is okay. This can be used to add
  # noise to the system and verify that calling systems support the
  # failure modes appropriately. The values MaxR and MaxT works as
  # in a standard fuse.

  # sync - call the fuse synchronously. This is the safe way where each
  # call is factored through the fuse server. It has no known race conditions.
  #
  # async_dirty - A fast call path, which circumvents the single fuse_server process.
  # It is much faster, but has been known to provide rare races in which
  # parallel processes might observe the wrong values. In other words,
  # with Context = async_dirty the calls are not linearizible.
