# FusePlay

To start your Phoenix app:

* Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
* Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

* This app does not use a database so if you have any errors related to the database ignore them

* Only two files are really important
  * [./web/controllers/page_controller.ex](https://github.com/Alequin/fuse-circuit-breaker-in-phoenix/blob/master/web/controllers/page_controller.ex)
  * [./mix.exs](https://github.com/Alequin/fuse-circuit-breaker-in-phoenix/blob/master/mix.exs)
